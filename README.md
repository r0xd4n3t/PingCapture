# ðŸ“œ Introduction

PingCapture is a versatile Python script designed to simplify the process of pinging a list of IP addresses, capturing screenshots, and logging ping results. 
Whether you're troubleshooting network connectivity, monitoring server health, or documenting your network's performance, PingCapture streamlines the task by 
automating the ping process, recording detailed logs, and providing visual snapshots of each step.

# Features
-    Effortless Ping Automation: PingCapture takes the hassle out of pinging multiple IP addresses by automating the entire process. Simply provide a list of targets and let the script handle the rest.
-    Comprehensive Logging: Every ping request's results are logged in detail. This helps you track changes, identify connectivity issues, and maintain a historical record of network performance.
-    Visual Verification: Alongside the detailed logs, PingCapture captures screenshots of the console after each ping operation. These screenshots provide visual confirmation of the executed commands and results.

# How It Works
1. Provide a list of IP addresses in a file.
2. Run the PingCapture script, specifying the IP list file and desired ping count.
3. PingCapture will sequentially ping each IP address, capture a screenshot of the console, and save the ping results to individual log files.

# Why PingCapture?

-    Saves Time and Effort: No need to manually ping each IP address one by one. PingCapture handles the repetitive tasks, letting you focus on analyzing the results.
-    Enhanced Troubleshooting: The combination of detailed logs and screenshots provides a comprehensive view of each ping operation, making it easier to diagnose network issues.
-     Useful for Documentation: PingCapture's output is ideal for documentation purposes, ensuring you have a clear record of network health and connectivity over time.
